Node.js Frameworks and Libraries Comparison

Overview

Express

A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's known for its simplicity, scalability, and speed, making it a popular choice for many developers.

Fastify

A fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js. Fastify is designed to be as efficient as possible in terms of speed and performance, making it suitable for building high-performance applications.

Koa

Developed by the creators of Express, Koa aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs. It leverages async functions to improve error handling and to increase readability and robustness of the application.

Hapi

A rich framework for building applications and services, offering a powerful plugin system that allows you to add new features and capabilities to your application easily.

Restify

Optimized for building semantically correct RESTful web services ready for production use at scale. Restify excels at building strict API services that need to be performant and scalable.

NestJS

A framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript, and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Sails.js

Especially good for building real-time features like chat applications, Sails.js is a model-view-controller (MVC) framework for Node.js that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps.

AdonisJs

A full-stack framework for Node.js that aims to make web development a breeze with a strong focus on developer ergonomics, stability, and confidence.

Feathers

An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications. Feathers can interact with any backend technology, supports over a dozen databases out of the box, and works with any frontend technology like React, VueJS, Angular, and web components.

Micro

A minimalistic and modular framework for building asynchronous HTTP microservices. It's designed to do one thing and do it well - to help you build microservices.

Polka

A minimalistic, express-like framework for Node.js that is fast and lightweight. It's designed to be a smaller, more performant alternative to Express.

Oak (Deno)

Designed specifically for use with Deno, the secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, Oak aims to provide a robust foundation for web applications with a similar middleware architecture to Koa.
